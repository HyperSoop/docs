# Fabric server setup
There are usually two reasons why you would want to use Fabric for your server:

- Getting good perfomance and keeping Vanilla parity.
- Hosting a server with content mods.

If your needs are neither of those, you should not use Fabric as your server software, as Paper/Purpur offers way more customization and choice in plugins.
Though there is a project called [Cardboard](https://github.com/CardboardPowered/cardboard) that allows running plugins on Fabric, it's still heavily in development and does not support the newest Minecraft versions.

### Base server setup
To install Fabric on your server, download a .jar from [fabricmc.net/use/server](fabricmc.net/use/server) and launch it like you would with any other server .jar. It will automaticially download the needed libraries and create a mods folder.

### Server optimization mods
Fabric, unlike Paper and such, does not carry any optimizations in itself, so it's not going to perform any better than vanilla.
Luckily, Fabric offers a choice of mods to optimize your server and/or replicate some of Paper's core features. The following is a list of the most notable server-side optimization mods - those are the ones you should have on your server 100% of the time, they won't change vanilla mechanics or cause any instability at all.

When installing any mods, look out for dependencies - usually it's at least [Fabric API]().

- [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) - arguably the most important server-side optimization mod, applies overall optimizations to ticking, chunk loading, AI and more.
- [FerriteCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/ferrite-core) - optimizes memory usage, works on both client and server. Can help you save up on RAM.
- [Krypton](https://modrinth.com/mod/krypton) - its main optimizations being on the server side, it optimizes Minecraft's networking stack (aka packet sending and other things related to networking).
- [LazyDFU](https://modrinth.com/mod/lazydfu) - makes DataFixerUpper "lazy", improving load times and decreasing lag spikes shortly after startup. 
- [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight) - a blazing fast rewrite of the lighting engine.

Now, those mods are less tested and more likely to cause issues/break vanilla parity, but are worth noting:

- [ServerCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/servercore) - ports some of Paper/Purpur's optimization options to Fabric, allowing you to set up villager lobotimization, entity activation ranges, mobcaps, and dynamic changing of view distance/tick distance/simulation distance depending on server load. This mod is intended to slightly break parity with vanilla for a perfomance boost.
- [C2ME](https://modrinth.com/mod/c2me-fabric) - applies experimental chunk loading and storage optimizations to the server, notably making more chunk loading and ticking run in parallel threads. It has a configuration file which lets you toggle all its optimizations on and off.
- [VMP](https://modrinth.com/mod/vmp-fabric) - applies experimental networking and ticking optimizations to help servers on high player counts.
- [FastLoad](https://modrinth.com/mod/fastload) - lets the server load less chunks on startup, improving startup times.
- [Memory Leak Fix](https://modrinth.com/mod/memoryleakfix) - fixes memory leaks and applies misc optimizations to the game.
